# Serial Communication App for CNC machines

This project came about when I worked for a company making their own CNC mill and lathe machines.  We needed a program to simply upload files to our larger CNC machines making our metal parts.  We searched for a simple solution, but the existing software/hardware products in the community were terrible and outdated.
